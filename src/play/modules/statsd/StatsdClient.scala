/**
 * Trait defining the statsd interface. It defines the two stats calls in
 * statsd: {@code increment} and {@code timing}. It must be instantiated with
 * {@link StatsdClientCake} which handles the sending of stats over the network.
 *
 * <p><ul>Two stats-related function are supported.
 * <li><b>increment</b>: Increment a given stat key.
 * <li><b>timing</b>: Sending timing info for a given operation key.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For both, an optional {@code samplingRate} parameter can be provided.
 * For parameters between 0 and 1.0, the client will send the stat
 * {@code (samplingRate * 100)%} of the time. This is useful for some stats that
 * occur extremely frequently and therefore put too much load on the statsd
 * server.
 *
 * <p>The functionality is exposed to Play Apps using the {@link Statsd} object.
